# Smart-Food-Management-Assistant

<h1>#AndroidDevChallenge</h1>

Food is one of primary needs for our life .Consuming healthy food gives us energy for work.
Sometimes it is difficult to take a decision for making food with the available ingredients in kitchen.

I propose the solution that will be on device ML based Android application which will help the user to make a decision on the basis of the available ingredients in kitchen .It not only help user to  but also help to making food by interacting with user and tell the recipe step by step.

<h3>All Functionalities:</h3>

I.	It gives suggestion to user what to make in the basis of available ingredients in kitchen with the help of machine learning model which     have inputs as food ingredients and the output gives the prediction of list of preparations .
II.	It also take care of user health. According to user body(height, weight, any disease user have) it will filter the foods and also           calculate the calories, protein, fat etc . This feature can be implemented by using custom Tensorflow model.

III.	Another big functionality of this app is if the user have excessive food then instead of wasting it they can donate the food to the         nearest NGO to distribute the food to the poor people who need it.

IV.	It can interact with user by voice recognition (This feature helps user to prepare a food item by telling the recipe step by step) and     it has also different language preference which need Google Speech API.

V.	Image prediction ML model which help user to identify a food item by using device camera.
